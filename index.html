          <h4>A little insight about me...</h4>
          <p>Greetings and hellos, thank you for taking interest in seeing what I've created here. I just wanted to introduce
            myself a little before you went on your way through the rest of my site. My name is <span class="tomatoe">Nate Moscato</span>,
            and to some, NayNay, which was homebrewed by my family, and grown into a moniker of mine. That, coupled with the Star
            Wars&copy; character title of Ren, has come to be <span class="purple">NayNayRen</span>, my social media and online gaming
            alias. I reside in the Tampa Bay area, where I was born and raised.</p>
          <p>I have a 13 year old Lab/Pitbull mix named <span class="tomatoe">Rommel</span> that I initially crossed paths with when he
            was five weeks young. I adore him more than anything else, that's my sidekick. I'm a big kid at heart, so gaming is a favorite
            pastime of mine, when there is time. And just to throw it in the mix, I also greatly enjoy the game of hockey, GO BOLTS and GO
            RANGERS!!!</p>
          <p>My first resume website was original created in 2018 towards the end of my Associate's degree, parts and pieces of which can
            be seen reworked here. I am on a journey to grow my creativity in the ways of web design by producing manageable, cleanly
            written code, alongside responsive and intriguing websites. The sections covering my <span class="purple">Education</span>
            and <span class="tomatoe">Projects</span> gives more on my schooling and creations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>After 22 years in restaraunts, I thought pursuing something new could be refreshing. A more in depth dive is down in my
        <span class="purple">Work</span> portion if you'd like. My goal in this is to be successful at designing websites, plain and simple.
        Please take a moment to cruise through my site, check out what I have covered through my studies, see some of the projects
        I've created, read a little of my work history, and if you would like to <span class="tomatoe">Contact</span> me, please do so
        through any means listed below. There is also a .pdf version of my resume if you're interested in that as well. It's located down
        with my media links.</p>

      <h4>A return to the books...</h4>
      <p>I returned to school in the Spring of 2016 and began taking classes at St. Petersburg College. I enrolled in the Computer
        Science program to learn how to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the creation of websites. The creativity
        of design, along with the background functionality, is what grabbed my attention.</p>
  		<p>So I switched my course track to accomidate Web Development. I had never done any kind of previous codeing. I gravitated
        towards the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a solid field to get into. Every business needs a website
        right? After two and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a full time work one, I finished my Associate in
        Science and a degree in Web Development. Now I pursue it as a new career.</p>

      <h4>Projects of an individual mind...</h4>
          <p>So here are a handful of projects that I have built. Scroll through each slide and if you'd like to visit each build just click
            the picture. These are school and personal builds that I thought would be a nice addition for your viewing pleasure. These
            were reworks done from originals of mine to somewhat update the look and make them more responsive to different screen
            sizes.</p>
          <p>All the code and full descriptions, plus a few more, can be found through my GitHub link at the bottom of the
          page. If you're keen on what you see, reach out to me via social media links below as well.</p>

      <h4>Go further into my work history...</h4>
      <p>I have 22 years in the restaurant industry, most of all that time served with one company. I am currently employed at a
        prosperous country club. Back when I started, I was bussing tables for the first four years of my young hospitality life. After a fluke
        of someone calling in sick one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the kitchen. I quickly learned all the
        skills needed, and memorized every recipe n order for me to advance through the ranks.</p>
			<p>Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten
				years later I was awarded the first of three kitchens directly under my management. My last stop was Sarasota, then
				I returned to the Tampa Bay area and went back to school, attending St. Petersburg College.</p>
